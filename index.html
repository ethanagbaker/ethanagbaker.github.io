            </header>
            <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at the <a href=http://www.pitt.edu>University of Pittsburgh</a> pursuing dual degrees in Neuroscience and Philosophy of Science. I am currently the William Shakespeare Fellow at <a href=http://www.cshl.edu>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> where I am working in the <a href=http://http://mccombielab.labsites.cshl.edu/>McCombie Lab</a> to improve NGS sequencing pipelines. Other current projects include development of computational models of neural circuits implicated in autonomic regulation with the <a href=http://www.neuroyates.com> Yates Lab</a> at the University of Pittsburgh. Past projects include a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the white pines with the <a href=http://http://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu/>Computational Genomics Laboratory</a> at the <a href=http://www.uconn.edu> University of Connecticut</a>.</p></p>

            <h3>Research Interests</h3>
            <p> My research interests are varied, but center at the intersection of genomics, medicine, computational biology, and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in applying bioinformatic and genomic techniques in the context of precision and personalized medicine relating to neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer.</p>
