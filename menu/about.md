### Hi there, I'm Ethan.

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu). I am a [Bachelor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Philosophy) candidate in the [Department of Neuroscience](http://neuroscience.pitt.edu), concentrating on computational biology and neuroinformatics. I'm also pursuing a Bachelor of the Arts in [History and Philosophy of Science](http://www.hps.pitt.edu). In September 2017, I will be joining the [Department of Biology](http://biology.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu) to start a PhD in computational biology and genomics.

Past adventures have led me to the [Gerstein Lab](http://gersteinlab.org) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu), where I worked on peak calling methods for massively parallel regulatory assays and to [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu), where I worked with the McCombie Lab to improve NGS sequencing pipelines and develop _in-silico_ [simulation software](http://silico.ethanagbaker.com) for generation of PacBio long read data.

Some other current projects include development of computational models of neural circuits implicated in autonomic regulation with the [Yates Lab](http://neuroyates.com) at the University of Pittsburgh. Some past projects include a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the white pines with the [Computational Genomics Laboratory](http://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu) at the [University of Connecticut](http://www.uconn.edu).

Outside of the lab, you can find me sailing, biking, hiking, or exploring Pittsburgh (probably by eating).
