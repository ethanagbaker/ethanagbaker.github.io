# Comparative Transcriptomics of White Pines

Conifers are the dominant plant species throughout the high latitude boreal forests as well as
some lower latitude temperate forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. As such, they play an integral
economic and ecological role across much of the world. This study focused on the characterization of needle
transcriptomes from four ecologically important and understudied North American white pines within the
Pinus subgenus Strobus. The populations of many Strobus species are challenged by native and introduced
pathogens, native insects, and abiotic factors. RNA from the needles of western white pine (Pinus monticola),
limber pine (Pinus flexilis), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) was sampled,
Illumina short read sequenced, and de novo assembled. The assembled transcripts and their subsequent
structural and functional annotations were processed through custom pipelines to contend with the challenges
of non-model organism transcriptome validation. Orthologous gene family analysis of over 58,000 translated
transcripts, implemented through Tribe-MCL, estimated the shared and unique gene space among the four
species. This revealed 2025 conserved gene families, of which 408 were aligned to estimate levels of divergence
and reveal patterns of selection. Specific candidate genes previously associated with drought
tolerance and white pine blister rust resistance in conifers were investigated.
