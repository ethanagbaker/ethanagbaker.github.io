## Philosophy of the Human Genome Project and the Post-Genomic Gene Concept

Since the Human Genome Project, advances in NGS technologies and computation have made available massive quantities of genetic data. As genetics (and biology) become “big data” fields, how has the gene concept evolved? I am currently working on a paper tentatively entitled *The Post-Genomic Gene: An Informatic View*, which draws on the (relatively recent) history of science to assess how technological advancements have changed our conception of the gene.
