SiLiCO (**Si**mulator of **L**ong Read Sequencing **i**n Pa**c**Bio and **O**xford Nanopore) is a simple software package for *in silico* generation of long read sequencing data. The preprint of the SiLiCO manuscript, written in conjunction with the McCombie Lab at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) is now available on BioRxiv. [You can read it here.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/22/076901)
