####Chancellor's Undergraduate Research Fellowship
_____
 I have been named a [Chancellor's Undergraduate Research Fellowship](http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/node/860) for the Spring 2016 semester. This award is in support of my [thesis work](http://ethanagbaker.github.io/projects/) on a neuroinformatic approach to characterizing autonomic regulation in response to vestibular stimuli.
