SiLiCO (**Si**mulator of **L**ong Read Sequencing **i**n Pa**c**Bio and **O**xford Nanopore) is a simple software package for *in silico* generation of long read sequencing data. The preprint of the SiLiCO manuscript, written in conjunction with the McCombie Lab at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://www.cshl.edu) is now available on BioRxiv. [You can read it here.](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/22/076901)

The SiLiCO package is written in Python 3 and is backwards compatible with Python 2.0 or newer. SiLiCO is open source software and is distributed under the GNU GPL 3.0 license. You can download SiLiCO and access its documentation at [silico.ethanagbaker.com](http://silico.ethanagbaker.com).
