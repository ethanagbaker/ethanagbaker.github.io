Welcome to the internet, me.
---
 This website runs on the super rad [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). That means it's totally open source and you can see the code for the entire site in my [GitHub repo for this site](https://github.com/ethanagbaker/ethanagbaker.github.io). I've modified the very nice [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme to build this site (also open-source).
