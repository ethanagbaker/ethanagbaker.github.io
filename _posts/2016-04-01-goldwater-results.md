 I have been awarded an Honorable Mention in the [Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/yybull.php) for the 2016 scholarship competition. The Goldwater Scholarship is the highest recognition given by the United States Government in recognition of undergraduate excellence in research in science and engineering. American universities may nominate up to 4 candidates to the national contest after a competitive internal selection process on the basis of acdemic record and a research proposal. I have proposed a novel machine learning strategy to identify candidate risk genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder using epigenetic information from ATAC-seq data.
