After many weeks of interviewing, and many more weeks of filling out applications, I have decided to join the [Department of Biology](http://biology.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu) beginning in Fall 2017. I look forward to writing much more about my graduate school and scientific experiences in the months and years ahead as I transition to life at MIT.
