Hey there, I'm Ethan. I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Biology](http://biology.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a graduate of the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu). My professional interests include gene regulatory networks, biomedical data science, design of computational methods for NGS data analysis for precision medicine, and issues of equitable access to emerging medical technologies.

I've previously worked in the [Gerstein Lab](http://gersteinlab.org) at [Yale University](http://yale.edu), the [Yates Lab](http://neuroyates.com) at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://pitt.edu), and the McCombie Lab at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu). I've also spent some time as a bioinformatician for the [Department of Developmental Biology](http://devbio.pitt.edu) at the [Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh](http://chp.edu).

Out of the lab, you can find me backpacking in the White Mountains (or sometimes someplace much colder), sailing, or eating my way through Cambridge.

If you're looking to learn even more about me, my [CV is available here]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}), or feel free to [get in touch](mailto:ethanagbaker+web@gmail.com).
