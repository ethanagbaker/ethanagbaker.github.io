Hey there, I'm Ethan. I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Biology](http://biology.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I am a member of the [Regev Lab](https://www.broadinstitute.org/regev-lab) at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://broadinstitute.org). My current work focuses on statistical and computational methods development for spatially-resolved single cell biology. I am broadly interested in how cellular communities form, evolve, and change in response to disease. On the side, I am passionate about ensuring equitable access to emerging technologies, scientific communication and data visualization, and using science as a catalyst for justice.

I've previously worked in the [Gerstein Lab](http://gersteinlab.org) at [Yale University](http://yale.edu), the [Yates Lab](http://neuroyates.com) at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://pitt.edu), and the McCombie Lab at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu). I've also spent some time as a bioinformatician for the [Department of Developmental Biology](http://devbio.pitt.edu) at the [Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh](http://chp.edu).

Out of the lab, you can find me backpacking in the White Mountains (or sometimes someplace much colder), sailing, or eating my way through Cambridge.

If you're looking to learn even more about me, my [CV is available here]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}), or feel free to [get in touch](mailto:ethanagbaker+web@gmail.com).
