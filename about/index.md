I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu). I am a [Bachelor of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Philosophy) candidate in the [Department of Neuroscience](http://neuroscience.pitt.edu), concentrating on computational biology and neuroinformatics. 
I'm also pursuing a Bachelor of the Arts in [History and Philosophy of Science](http://www.hps.pitt.edu).
  
<br>

Currently, I am the William Shakespeare Fellow at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu) where I am working in the McCombie Lab to improve NGS sequencing pipelines. 
Other current projects include development of computational models of neural circuits implicated in autonomic regulation with the [Yates Lab](http://neuroyates.com) at the University of Pittsburgh. 
Past projects include a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the white pines with the [Computational Genomics Laboratory](http://compgenomics.lab.uconn.edu) at the [University of Connecticut](http://www.uconn.edu).
