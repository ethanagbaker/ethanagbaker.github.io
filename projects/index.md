### Research Interests
My research interests are varied, but center at the intersection of genomics, medicine, computational biology, and bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in applying bioinformatic and genomic techniques in the context of precision and personalized medicine relating to neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer. I am also interested in ethical issues related to genomic medicine and ensuring equitable access to cutting edge medical technologies.

### Projects

##### Computational Modeling of Neural Mechanism Driving Blood Pressure Regulation

The most essential function of the nervous system is to maintain homeostasis. My Bachelor of Philosophy thesis with the [Yates Lab\(http://neuroyates.com) at the University of Pittsburgh is attempting to define a computational model for the neural and vestibular processes responsible for modulation of blood flow and pressure during postural changes. I am employing strategies from data science, statistics, and bioinformatics to make sense of massive quantities of neural and blood flow recording data.

##### Mechanics of Next Generation Sequencing Library Failure 
Why do some libraries perform far better than others during next-generation sequencing? Work with the McCombie Lab at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](http://cshl.edu) attempts to better characterize causes of NGS sequencing failure and where damage happens. See our abstract submitted to AGBT 2016 here. (upon publication)

##### Comparative Needle Transcriptomics in White Pines
Conifers are the dominant class of tree species across much of the North and play an essential ecological and economic role. Conifers have genomes several times the size of the human genome, presenting unique computational challenges. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of several non-model conifers, providing new insight on gene conservation across the pines. Read our paper in G3 (In review). 

##### Addressing Health Disparities: Lessons from Latin American Social Medicine
How do social factors like class, violence, nutrition, and race affect health? Should healthcare providers expand their conception of health to include and treat these problems? As a [Brackenridge Fellow](http://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/fall-spring-brackenridge-fellowships) I am working with the [Center for Bioethics and Health Law](http://www.bioethics.pitt.edu/) to provide answers on what the United States could learn by looking to its neighbors south of the border.
